          <h1>Report</h1>
          This is my report, I will be talking about my experience about web development and the code, design and the issues I have had with creating the website. The first thing that I had to do was set up the file, secondly, I created all five pages which were the index page, portfolio, contact, cv and the site report. I found that creating the layout out for the web page the hardest as I am not used to using HTML.The first website that I created did not have a header or a footer which meant that the naviagtion bar and the text overlapped and got placed in random positions of the page. The design that I picked was simple with a header, footer but was effective and responsive when loaded onto a web page, which meant that the user could move around on the website smoothly. I found that using websites such as www.w3scchools.com helped a lot as it helped me to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Making the CSS was easier for me as it was just formatting the page and giving the headers and the background colours. The only issue that I had with the CSS was adding different colours to different headers which were on different pages. The index page has a brief introduction to what the portfolios for, the portfolio has a list of all my modules and two place holder images, the contact form has a form which can be filled and has my contact details, CV page has my CV that I used to apply for university and finally the site report which talks about my struggles and positives of this module.
